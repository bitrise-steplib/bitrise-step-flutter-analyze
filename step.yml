   Expo is a toolchain that allows you to quickly get a React Native app up and running without having to use native code in Xcode or Android Studio. The Expo Eject Step is necessary to eject your app to install any missing native dependencies. Installing the native dependencies is done by our dedicated Steps, such as **Install missing Android SDK components** and **Run CocoaPods install**.

   ### Configuring the Step

   1. Add the Step to your Workflow after the Step or Steps that install your app's Javascript dependencies (such as **Run npm command** or **Run yarn command**).

   1. Set the **Working directory input field** to the value of your project directory. By default, you do not have to change this.

   1. Specify the Expo CLI version.

      The default value is `latest` but you can specify an exact version, such as 3.0.0.

   1. If your app uses an Expo SDK, you must provide the username and password for your Expo account! Without it, the Expo SDK imports will stop working.

   ### Troubleshooting

   If the Expo CLI used the default `--eject-method` and your SDK imports stop working, check your Expo username and password.

   Make sure that the Expo CLI version you use is compatible with your app.
